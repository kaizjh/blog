Building Abstractions with Functions
----------
We have identified in Python some of the elements that must appear in any powerful programming language:
1. Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive built-in data values and functions.
2. Nested function application provides a means of combining operations.
3. Binding names to values provides a limited means of abstraction.

This principle -- that the meaning of a function should be independent of the parameter names chosen by its author -- has important consequences for programming languages.

**Aspects of a functional abstraction**
To master the use of a functional abstraction, it is often useful to consider its three core attributes. The domain of a function is the set of arguments it can take. The range of a function is the set of values it can return. The intent of a function is the relationship it computes between inputs and output (as well as any side effects it might generate). Understanding functional abstractions via their domain, range, and intent is critical to using them correctly in a complex program.

**Functional Abstractions**
Functional Abstractions is giving a name to some computational process, and then referring to that process as a whole without worrying about its implementation details.
