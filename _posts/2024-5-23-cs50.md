本课程以C语言为主，其次是Python，SQLite也略有涉及，HTML, CSS, JavaScript都只是稍作点拨




# 学习笔记摘录
完整笔记使用word记录
## Algorithm 24.4.12
In programming, it is always “wrong” to repeat. It means, there always an “elegant” way to avoid repeating, because the computer is designed to avoid repeating.

To judge a algorithm, we use O (big oh) to represent the upper bond of a algorithm, e.g. O(n) = n 
这个大O符号应该在高等数学中表示无穷的时候出现过（[2 渐近分析：大O记号、小o记号与“~”记号 - 知乎用户hNma4s的文章 - 知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/33357254)）

## Memory 24.4.23
0 1 is binary, here 0/1 is a binary digit -- a bit（位，比特）;
0 1 … 9 A B … F is hexadecimal, since 16 is 2^4, 0xF(0x.. means hexadecimal..) can be represented by 4bits 1111;
With many reasons, 1byte（字节） = 8bits, so, 0xFF is 1byte, 8bits 1111 1111 [了解更多](http://t.csdnimg.cn/0YEUT)
Hexadecimal use a lot in color system in computer, like RGB:

| 0xff | 0xffffff  |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| a color(Red/Green/Blue) | a color(black, with Red, Green, Blue mixed) |
| 1byte | 3bytes |
| 8bits | 24bits |
|       | a pixel in a 24-bits BMP(BitMaP) file |

The abstract data type -- Stack is Last In First Out a.k.a. LIFO:
When a new function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the top of the stack and becomes the active frame.  When a function finishes its work, its frame is popped off of the stack, and the frame immediately below it becomes the new, active, function on the top of the stack.
Another abstract data type -- queue is First In First Out a.k.a. FIFO.

## Data Structures 24.4.27

Hash tables, it turns out that, are wonderful application of arrays and linked lists (using pointers to make noncontiguous arrays) to try to leverage the best of both worlds.

In CS50, we’ve covered a lot of different data structures. We’ve seen arrays, linked lists,  stacks  and queues, hash tables, trees, tries. But there really are these kinds of four basic ideas that everything else can boil down to: Arrays, Linked lists, Hash tables and Tries.
Every kind of structure has its pros and cons, has its trade-off.

| Kind | Insertion | Deletion | Lookup | Sort | Size | Flexibility |
|:------------:|:--------:|:------:|:----:|:--:|:--:|:---------:|
|   Arrays     | bad     |  bad | great (constant time) | easy | small | no         |
| Linked lists | easy    | easy | bad    | difficult | small | yes       |
|  Hash tables | easy    | easy | on average (faster than Linked list, slower than Arrays) | not good | big |yes|
|    Tries     | complex | easy | fast(constant time) | already sorted | rapidly becomes huge | yes   |

I think for loop is more easy to understand and to write than while loop (and I made mistakes in L5/ps5/speller/dictionary.c/35:  with while loop).

## Python 24.5.2
Up until now in C, we’ve been focusing on what’s called really procedural programming (procedure-oriented programming). You write procedures, you write functions, top to bottom, left to right. And when you want to change some value, we were in the habit of using a procedure, that is, a function. You would pass something, like a variable, into a function, like toupper( ) ot tolower( ), and it would do its thing and hand you back a value.

Well, it turns out that it would be nicer, programming-wise, if some data types just had built-in functionality, like why do we have our variables over here and all of our helper functions, like toupper( ) and tolower( ) over here, such that we constantly have to pass one into the other?

So, object-oriented programming, also known as OOP, is a technique whereby certain types of values, like a string, a.k.a. str (in Python), not only have properties inside of them, attributes, just like a struct in C, you data can also have functions built into them as well. 

Whereas in C, which is not object-oriented, you have structs, and structs can only store data, like a name and a number, when implementing a person. In Python, you can, for instance, have not just a structure, otherwise known as class, storing a name and a number, you can have a function like call that person, or email that person, or actual verbs or actions associated with that piece of data.

Dictionary  (in python) is just so wonderfully convenient, because now you can associate anything with anything else, but not using numbers, but entire keywords instead. Strings commonly serve as keys, because strings are our conventional representation for names of things.（相较于一串数字，人们可能更喜欢看到字符——英文字符或中文字符，比如用域名来代替一串数字IP地址）

And of all of the data structures, a dictionary, a hash table, is really like the Swiss Army knife of computing, because it just lets you associate something with something else. That’s a really powerful thing, because it’s more powerful than lists and arrays, which are only numbers and something else. Now you can have any sorts of relationships instead.

Tuples are ordered, immutable sets of data; they are great for associating collections of data, sort of like a struct in C, but where those values are unlikely to change.

## SQL 24.5.5
SQL really just does four basic things: CRUD, Creating data, Reading data, Updating data, Deleting data.
here are some keywords in SQL, sorted and correspond with CRUD:
CREATE, INSERT;		SELECT;			UPDATE;		DELETE, DROP




# 一些感想

## 24.4.28
24.4.8 开始学习 CS50，现在 CS50 应该已经学习了有十几天几十个小时了，昨天把Lecture4 的配套作业做完了，section，shorts 也都看完了，今天准备进入Lecture5 的学习，说实话，我很喜欢这门课程，老师在讲台上讲的很有激情，而且内容丰富，且生动形象（比如用一个伸出食指的手套来表示C语言中的pointer）。并且有非常详细的配套视频shorts和section，会帮助我理解老师在Lecture 中讲到的很多概念。以及配套作业problem set，自己完成这些作业能让我更深入地理解课程内容！而且我觉得我很喜欢这种了解CS原理的过程，比如，我在problem set 4 中了解到了图片、音频都是由很多bits 组成的，而通过对文件中bits 或者bytes 的操作，我可以转换声音的大小，图片的颜色（即filter，滤镜），甚至是恢复已经被删除的图片文件，这真是很奇妙啊！总之，我非常高兴能够免费学习这么好的课程，I love CS50!!!

## 24.5.23
截止今天，CS50的课程基本上是结束了，但是final project 还没有完成，因为它自由度比较高，我一时也不知道该怎么去完成一个完全属于我自己的project，所以，经过45天左右的学习，CS50 的学习基本上先告一段落了，这门课程是非常非常优秀的一门课程，是我见过的最好的一门课程，而且是完全免费的。
通过CS50的学习，我从二进制01一路学习到了互联网，更深入地了解了作为基础的C语言，也对Python、HTML、CSS、JavaScript这些编程语言或标记语言有了一些很浅的了解。看到了我们每天都在使用的万维网（world wide web）的背后的原理，我感到非常激动，学习这个课程进一步地激发了我学习计算机科学的激情。
